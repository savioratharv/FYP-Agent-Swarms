# TODO App Documentation

## Overview

This document provides a function-by-function breakdown of the `main.py` file, which serves as the entry point for a simple TODO application built using a `TaskManager` class. The application allows users to manage tasks through a console interface.

## Functions

### main()

#### Summary
The `main` function serves as the primary execution point for the TODO application. It handles user interaction by displaying a menu and processing user input to manage tasks.

#### Key Tasks
1. **Initialization of TaskManager**: 
   - An instance of the `TaskManager` class is created upon invocation, which initializes task management capabilities.

2. **User Interaction Loop**: 
   - A continuous loop prompts the user to select an action until they choose to exit.

3. **Menu Display**: 
   - Presents a simple text menu to the user with options to add, remove, list tasks, or exit the application.

4. **Input Handling**:
   - Processes user choice input to execute corresponding task management functions:
     - **Add Task**: Calls `manager.add_task(task)` to add a new task.
     - **Remove Task**: Calls `manager.remove_task(task)` to delete a specified task.
     - **List Tasks**: Calls `manager.list_tasks()` to display all current tasks.
     - **Exit**: Breaks the loop and terminates the application.

5. **Error Handling**:
   - Validates user input to ensure the selected option is within the expected range. Prompts the user again in case of invalid input.

#### Return Value
- The function does not return any value. It relies on controlling application flow and interacting with the user and `TaskManager` for task management.
