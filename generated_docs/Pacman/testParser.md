# TestParser Documentation

## Overview

The `TestParser` class provides functionality to read and parse test case files for a larger software project, specifically designed to handle test cases while ignoring comments and formatting the output appropriately.

### Class: `TestParser`

#### Constructor: `__init__(self, path)`
- **Purpose**: Initializes a new instance of the `TestParser` class.
- **Parameters**:
  - `path`: A string representing the file path to the test case file.
  
### Method: `removeComments(self, rawlines)`
- **Purpose**: Removes comments from the provided raw lines of text.
- **Parameters**:
  - `rawlines`: A list of strings, where each string represents a line from the test case file.
- **Returns**: A single string containing all lines without comments, with comments stripped out.

### Method: `parse(self)`
- **Purpose**: Reads the test case file, processes the lines, and populates the test dictionary with parsed values.
- **Returns**: A dictionary containing parsed data from the test file, with keys corresponding to properties and values as their respective contents.
- **Process**:
  1. Opens the specified test case file and reads all lines into `raw_lines`.
  2. Calls `removeComments` to strip comments from the lines, creating a clean text representation.
  3. Initializes a test dictionary to store parsed properties.
  4. Iterates through the cleaned lines:
     - Skips blank lines while still preserving them in the raw format.
     - Matches single-line properties and stores them in the dictionary.
     - Matches multi-line properties enclosed in triple quotes and stores them in the dictionary.
     - If a line does not conform to expected patterns, an error message is printed and the execution halts.

### Function: `emitTestDict(testDict, handle)`
- **Purpose**: Writes the contents of the test dictionary back to a specified file handle in a structured format.
- **Parameters**:
  - `testDict`: A dictionary containing parsed test data to be written out.
  - `handle`: A file handle to which the formatted content should be written.
- **Process**:
  - Iterates over the emitted entries in the provided test dictionary.
  - Writes raw lines, single-line properties, and multi-line properties to the file in the original format.
